# Simple JDA Template
This is a very basic Java Discord Bot template which has a Slash Commands Handler. It uses the [JDA library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your desired program. I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
3. Open the pom.xml and then install the required dependencies.
4. Locate the `Bot` class and change `token` to your token which you can get at [the Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) by creating an application.
- Make sure to select `bot` and `application.commands` as your OAuth scopes!
5. Start making a bot!
